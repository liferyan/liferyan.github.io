## Before You Ask

Before asking a technical question by e-mail, or in a newsgroup, or on a website chat board, do the following:

1. Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.
2. Try to find an answer by searching the Web.
3. Try to find an answer by reading the manual.
4. Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.
5. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.
6. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.
7. If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.

When you ask your question, display the fact that you have done these things first; this will help establish that you're not being a lazy sponge and wasting people's time. Better yet, display what you have *learned* from doing these things. We like answering questions for people who have demonstrated they can learn from the answers.

## 在提问之前

在你准备要通过电子邮件、新闻群组或者聊天室提出技术问题前，请先做到以下事情：

1. 尝试在你准备提问的论坛的旧文章中搜索答案。
2. 尝试上网搜索以找到答案。
3. 尝试阅读手册以找到答案。
4. 尝试阅读常见问题文件（FAQ）以找到答案。
5. 尝试自己检查或试验以找到答案。
6. 向你身边的强者朋友打听以找到答案。
7. 如果你是程序开发者，请尝试阅读源代码以找到答案。

当你提出问题的时候，请先表明你已经做了上述的努力；这将有助于树立你并不是一个不劳而获且浪费别人的时间的提问者。如果你能一并表达在做了上述努力的过程中所**学到**的东西会更好，因为我们更乐于回答那些表现出能从答案中学习的人的问题。
